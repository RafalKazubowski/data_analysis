### The repository includes notebooks in which I show various aspects of data analysis. From data preparation to definition of conclusions.

In the files *...preparing the dataset ...* I use the pandas and numpy library to focus on:
- deduplication
- cleaning float values
- converting to bool type
- converting to datetime type
- text cleaning

Here *car-statistics and visualization* I use the pandas and the seaborn library to present:
- aggregated data in charts
- aggregated data in tables
